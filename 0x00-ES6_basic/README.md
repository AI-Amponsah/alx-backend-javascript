# 0x00. ES6 Basics

## Overview

This project covers the basics of modern JavaScript using ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features. It involves learning about new concepts and syntax introduced in ES6, such as arrow functions, default parameters, rest parameters, string templating, block-scoped variables, object creation, iterators, and for-of loops.

### Concepts Covered

- Modern JavaScript
- Software Linter

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without needing to search for help:

1. What is ES6 and its significance in modern JavaScript development.
2. Understanding the new features introduced in ES6.
3. Differentiating between constants and variables.
4. Block-scoped variables and their usage in ES6.
5. Arrow functions and how function parameters default to them.
6. Rest and spread function parameters and their applications.
7. String templating in ES6 and how it simplifies string interpolation.
8. Object creation and manipulation using ES6 syntax.
9. Iterators and their role in ES6, along with the usage of for-of loops.

### Requirements

- All the code files should be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x.
- The allowed editors for this project are vi, vim, emacs, and Visual Studio Code.
- Ensure that all your code files end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory to document the project.
- All code files should use the `.js` extension.
- The code will be tested using the Jest Testing Framework.
- The code will be analyzed using the ESLint linter with specific provided rules.

### Resources

Before starting the project, review the following resources:

- [ECMAScript 6 - ECMAScript 2015](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/)
- [Statements and declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#declarations)
- [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
- [Default parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters)
- [Rest parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)
- [Javascript ES6 â€” Iterables and Iterators](https://dev.to/gspteck/javascript-es6---iterables-and-iterators)

### How to Use the Code

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have NodeJS 12.11.x and Jest Testing Framework installed.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Implement the required functions in the provided files, using ES6 features as necessary.
5. Run `npm test` to run the Jest tests and verify the correctness of your code.
6. Use ESLint to ensure your code adheres to the provided coding standards and rules.
7. Make any necessary corrections based on the test results and linter feedback.
8. Once all tests pass and the code meets the project requirements, you can consider the project complete.

### Project Completion

At the end of this project, you should have a deeper understanding of modern JavaScript with ES6 features. The project should demonstrate your proficiency in using ES6 syntax and concepts, along with your ability to write clean and well-structured code.
